# VBA-challenge
#script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
    #The ticker symbol
    #Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    #The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    #Add functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
    # conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
    # run on every worksheet at once.
## Instructions
- Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
    - The ticker symbol
    - Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
    - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
